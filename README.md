StatsGUI

Hi,

StatsGUI is very specific program to read CSV files which some record labels use to share statistics about
digital distribution of a band or an artist. Also for practicing JavaFX.

Not the most user friendly program, since if one wants to change file to read, it must be done through changing
the parameter of a "Logic" object in code. 

Otherwise UX is rather pleasant and clear.

Contains example file "stats.csv" which is based on actual label's CSV file.


Yours truly,

Sampo
