StatsGUI

Hi,

StatsGUI is very specific program to read CSV files which some music record labels use to share statistics about
digital distribution of an album and related singles. Also for practicing JavaFX.

Not the most user friendly program, since if one wants to change file to read, it must be done through changing
the parameter of a "Logic" object in code. 

Otherwise UX is rather intuitive and pleasant. Quite retro, since JavaFX.

Contains example file "stats.csv" which is based on actual label's CSV file.


Yours truly,

Sampo
